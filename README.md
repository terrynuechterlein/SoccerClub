# SoccerClub Website

The official web platform for the Kalamazoo College Soccer Club. A hub for members to engage, view schedules, explore photos, and connect over their shared passion for soccer.

## Overview
I founded the Kalamazoo College Soccer Club during my junior year at Kalamazoo College, the soccer club served as a network for students enthusiastic about the sport. The main attraction of our regular meetings was the king of the court pickup matches. Notably, in my senior year, the "Campus Cup" event was introduced - a competition inviting students and faculty from various campuses to participate.

This website was envisioned and brought to life as an auxiliary project to support the Soccer Club's initiatives and provide members with an interactive and user-friendly platform.

### Setup
Prerequisites: Ensure you have XAMPP (or WAMPP's equivalent) installed on your system. This will provide you with both the Apache server and the MySQL server essential for the web app.

Database Setup: Create a database named login_db in your MySQL setup. Once created, import the provided SQL file to set up the necessary tables and configurations.

Server: Ensure both Apache and MySQL servers are running via the XAMPP control panel.

Connection Configuration: The app is pre-configured to connect to the database. If your setup uses different credentials, please adjust the connection details in connection.php.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter a "failed to connect" error, verify that:

▶Your MySQL server is running.
▶The database exists and the SQL file has been imported.
▶The database connection credentials in connection.php match your setup.
